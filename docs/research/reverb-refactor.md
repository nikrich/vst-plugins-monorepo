Short answer: yes—this lines up really well with the design we discussed.
You’ve implemented the key ingredients of a Valhalla‑style algorithmic reverb:

Input diffusion: 4× Schroeder allpasses per channel (short delays, unity‑gain 2‑multiply form).

FDN core: 8‑line FDN with a unitary Hadamard feedback matrix (proper 1/√8 scaling).

RT60 mapping: g = 10^(-3 * Lmax / (T60 * fs)) (conservative, stable).

Damping: per‑line 1‑pole LP (TPT).

Modulation: fractional delay with sine LFOs + tiny jitter, applied mainly to the longest lines.

Predelay + early reflection “feel”: separate predelay + blend a touch of diffused ER into the wet.

Perf-minded details: power‑of‑two buffers, bitmask wraps, no allocations in the audio path, ScopedNoDenormals.

That’s the spine of a modern, efficient, lush reverb. Nicely done.

High‑leverage tweaks I recommend
1) Make delay capacity future‑proof across SR/Size/Mod

Right now you hard‑limit each FDN line to ~0.15 * fs seconds. With 96 kHz and size = 1.5 (and your longest base = 6229@48k), you’ll overflow the intended range and silently clamp delay lengths. Compute capacity from the worst case instead:

// In FDN8::prepare
const int baseMax48k = 6229;              // your longest base at 48k
const float sizeMax  = 1.5f;              // your max Size
const float modMaxS  = 10e-3f * fs;       // max mod depth in samples (10 ms)
const double scale   = fs / 48000.0;
const double need    = baseMax48k * scale * sizeMax + modMaxS + 4.0;
const int maxDelaySamples = DelayLine::nextPow2((int) std::ceil(need));

for (int i = 0; i < NumLines; ++i) {
    lines[i].prepare(fs, maxDelaySamples);
    // ...
}


This ensures the line buffers are always big enough for any SR/Size/Mod you expose.

2) Apply damping only to the feedback energy, not the new input

In FDN8::tick you low‑pass the sum of feedback and injected input. You’ll get a subtly darker onset than necessary. Prefer:

// 2) Hadamard -> fb[]
// 3) Damped feedback + *undamped* input injection
float fb = fb[i] * gi[i];
float damped = dampers[i].processSample(fb); // LP only on the recirculating path
float in = inputTap(i) * x;                  // bright ER feed
lines[i].pushSample(damped + in);


This keeps early/ER content brighter while the tail darkens naturally.

3) Fix parameter smoothing (you’re not actually smoothing)

You call setCurrentAndTargetValue() and then read getCurrentValue() per sample. That bypasses smoothing. Use targets and step each sample:

// init once
mixSmoothed.reset(fs, 0.05);
widthSmoothed.reset(fs, 0.05);

// on param change
mixSmoothed.setTargetValue(juce::jlimit(0.0f, 1.0f, params.mixPercent * 0.01f));
widthSmoothed.setTargetValue(juce::jlimit(0.0f, 1.0f, params.width));

// in the process loop, per sample:
const float mix      = mixSmoothed.getNextValue();
const float widthNow = widthSmoothed.getNextValue();


(If you want block‑wise stepping, call skip(numSamples) once per block and keep getCurrentValue() inside the loop.)

4) Avoid hard clamps in the feedback path

This line adds noticeable nonlinearity:

in = std::clamp(in, -10.0f, 10.0f);


If it’s a safety net, keep it debug‑only, or replace with a very high threshold soft‑saturator in a “dirty/vintage” mode only. Otherwise remove it to keep the core late field linear.

5) Keep headers JUCE‑agnostic

FDN8::mixStereo calls juce::jlimit inside a DSP header that doesn’t include JUCE. Prefer:

const float w = std::clamp(width, 0.0f, 1.0f);


(And note that M_PI is not portable on MSVC; consider juce::MathConstants<float>::pi or your own constant in headers that must compile everywhere.)

6) A couple of micro‑perf & correctness nits

In DelayLine::readFractional compute k = floor(rIdx) once, reuse for i0 and frac.

Guard total delay: totalDelaySamples should be clamped to [1, capacity()-2] to avoid reading past stale memory on extreme mod (it’s already okay with the capacity fix above).

Consider using std::array<float, 8> for the small vectors in hot paths (e.g., v, fb) to enable better stack allocation & possible auto‑vectorization.

Your Hadamard is great—keep it unrolled and scaled (you already do).

Sound‑quality polish (nice‑to‑have)

True‑stereo late field (when CPU allows):
Run two FDN8 instances (L and R) with permuted delay maps and uncorrelated LFOs. Feed each side mostly from its own channel (with a little crossfeed). It widens the field and improves mono compatibility over a single FDN with stereo taps.

Diffusion range:
Your ER allpasses are set to g≈0.7 and you map diffusion up to ~0.95. With 5–11 ms delays, g>~0.85 can ring. I’d cap the ER chain near 0.80–0.85 and push density in the FDN instead.

Freeze mode (you already have a flag):

Set gi → ~0.9999f (or 1.0 if you also disable damping).

Disable damping (hfHz → 20 kHz) or compensate.

Stop input injection (set input taps to 0) so it sustains what’s already in the tank.

Optional: reduce modulation during freeze to avoid perceptible pitch wander.

Width behavior:
Your M/S derivation is fine. Consider a subtle L/R decorrelation allpass at the outputs (1–3 ms, low g) to reduce correlation further at narrow width.

Optional “era/dirty” modes:

Fixed‑point quantization in feedback (low‑level noise + slight saturation).

Noisy/tapered modulators for “chaotic” modes.

Bright “plate” mode = higher ER diffusion + less damping + a touch more modulation depth.

Level management:
You boost wet by 1.2×. Another option is a light feedback‑dependent normalization or a “Make‑Up” knob so 100% wet isn’t perceived as too quiet at short decays.

Small diffs (illustrative)

Damping placement:

// before
float in = dampers[i].processSample(fb[i] * gi[i] + inputTap(i) * x);

// after
float fb      = fb[i] * gi[i];
float damped  = dampers[i].processSample(fb);
float in      = damped + inputTap(i) * x;
lines[i].pushSample(in);


Capacity sizing:

const int baseMax48k = 6229;
const float sizeMax  = 1.5f;
const float modMaxS  = (10e-3f) * fs;
const double scale   = fs / 48000.0;
const int maxDelaySamples = DelayLine::nextPow2((int)std::ceil(baseMax48k * scale * sizeMax + modMaxS + 4));
for (int i = 0; i < NumLines; ++i) lines[i].prepare(fs, maxDelaySamples);


SmoothedValue usage in process:

const float widthNow = widthSmoothed.getNextValue();
const float mix      = mixSmoothed.getNextValue();


Header clamp:

// replace juce::jlimit in FDN8 header
const float w = std::clamp(width, 0.0f, 1.0f);

Verdict

Overall, you’ve built a clean, modern, efficient algorithmic reverb that squarely matches the recommended architecture: ER diffusion → 8×8 unitary FDN with damping + modulation → stereo taps, wrapped in a JUCE‑friendly engine.

Apply the capacity fix, move damping to the feedback‑only path, correct the parameter smoothing, and (optionally) add a true‑stereo variant / freeze polish. Those changes will make it both more robust and closer to that Valhalla‑style feel while staying performant.
