## Plugins

### Astral Halls (Reverb)
Astral Halls is a modern reverb built on an FDN-based architecture designed for lush, dense, and stable tails with controllable tone and width.

- Core: 8-line Feedback Delay Network (FDN8) with a scaled Hadamard mixer
- Front end: per‑channel predelay and multi‑stage allpass diffusion for smooth early energy
- Late field: per-line HF damping, subtle modulation for decorrelation, and width control (M/S)
- Post: low/high cut EQ and smoothed wet/dry mix; optional freeze for infinite sustain

For a deeper dive into the architecture, parameters, and roadmap, see docs/readme/astral-halls.md.

### Spectral Limiter (Limiter)
A transparent, modern true‑peak limiter focused on punchy, artifact‑free loudness.

- True‑peak safe via internal oversampling (4×/8× depending on sample rate)
- Look‑ahead with a sliding‑window moving maximum detector so peaks can’t slip through
- Musical, log‑domain release smoothing; stereo max‑linking to preserve imaging
- Optional sidechain HPF to reduce pumping and a gentle safety soft clip under the ceiling
- Proper latency reporting to the host

For full signal flow, parameters, and integration notes, see docs/readme/spectral-limiter.md.
